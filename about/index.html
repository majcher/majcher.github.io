		My name is Michał Majcherski. At work I'm a Java developer with 6 years of proffessional experience in design, implementation and maintanace of complex IT systems.
		After work I'm discovering secrets of clean code, test driven software development process and the like, sometimes with use of other JVM based languages like Groovy.
		In recent years I was also exploring mobile applications world. I wrote several Google Android applications and also tasted iOS development.
